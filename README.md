# WPF-Samples
This repo contains the samples that demonstrate the API usage patterns and popular features for the Windows Presenation Foundation in the .NET Framework for Desktop. These samples were initially hosted on [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/ms771633.aspx), and we are gradually 
moving all the interesting WPF samples over to GitHub.All the samples have been retargeted to .NET 4.5.2.

For additional WPF samples, see [WPF Samples](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/ms771633.aspx).
